### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan Schlegel, a driven MSc Statistics student at ETH Zurich, deeply fascinated by the worlds of mathematical statistics and machine learning. My academic journey is rooted in a strong quantitative finance background, where I've honed my skills in data analysis, time series, machine learning, quantitative risk management, and statistical modelling.

Beyond the numbers, I'm a chess enthusiast (albeit more passionate than skilled) and a coder fluent in Python, R, and several other data science tools. Currently, I'm applying my expertise in various projects, focusing on leveraging statistical methods to solve complex problems.

Here on GitHub, you'll find projects that showcase my journey through statistics and machine learning. Feel free to reach out to me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-heinrich-schlegel/)
