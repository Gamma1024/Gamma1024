### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan Schlegel, a driven MSc Statistics student at ETH Zurich, deeply fascinated by the worlds of mathematical statistics and machine learning. Beyond the numbers, I'm a coder fluent in Python, R, and several other data science tools. Currently, I'm applying my expertise in various projects, focusing on leveraging statistical methods to solve complex problems.
