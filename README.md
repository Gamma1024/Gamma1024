### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan Schlegel, a driven MSc Statistics student at ETH Zurich, deeply fascinated by the worlds of mathematical statistics and machine learning. Beyond the numbers, I'm a coder fluent in Python, R, and several other data science tools. Currently, I'm applying my expertise in various projects, focusing on leveraging statistical methods to solve complex problems.

Here on GitHub, you'll find projects that showcase my journey through statistics and machine learning. Feel free to reach out to me: [![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-heinrich-schlegel/)
